# Introduction - Our Lab Repository

Our Lab 6 Repository is a simple program that takes your name and a number. It then outputs that number multiplied by all integers from 1 to 10.

# How to Use Our Program

Our program is contained in the file "Multiplication.ipynb". In order to use it, download the file or copy our repository to your computer. To copy the repository, open up your computer's terminal, type git clone https://github.com/jackieco25/Lab_Repository.git , and press enter. The files will then be transferred to your computer. 

To use the program, input your name and a number that you want to multiply. There is an example of what it looks like when it runs underneath the code cell in the Jupyter notebook.

# Got a suggestion?

We would love your suggestions and improvements. To do so, please make your improvements and commit them in your terminal with `git commit`. Then, push the files back to github with `git push origin main`, where we can then review and accept them. Thank you for your efforts to improve our program.
